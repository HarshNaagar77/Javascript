**Step 1: HTML Structure**
The HTML code sets up the basic structure of the web page. It includes a `<div>` element with the text "hello" and a `<script>` element that contains the JavaScript code.

**Step 2: Fetching Data from the API**
The JavaScript code uses the `fetch()` function to make a request to the random user API at the URL "https://randomuser.me/api/". This API provides random user data in JSON format.

**Step 3: Handling the Response**
The `fetch()` function returns a promise, which represents the eventual completion (or failure) of the request. The `.then()` method is used to handle the promise and process the response. The first `.then()` function takes the response from the API and converts it to JSON format using the `res.json()` method.

**Step 4: Displaying the Data**
The second `.then()` function takes the JSON data and logs it to the console using the `console.log()` method. This allows you to see the user data in the browser's console.

**Step 5: Error Handling**
The `.catch()` method is used to handle any errors that may occur during the process. If an error occurs, it logs the message "Error found" to the console.
